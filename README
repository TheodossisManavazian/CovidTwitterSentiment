LoadCSV.py
#-----------------------#

Run this file to create CSV files with data from twitter containing the #Coronavius AND #COVID-19

#---- LoadData ----#
The function loadData can be modified to accept any query however for this project i didn't feel like it was necessary
loadData takes 3 parameters, StartDate, Items, filename

StartDate is a date(No earlier than 1 week prior to the current date) in string form "YYYY-MM-DD"
Items is the amount of tweets that you would like to retrieve -- Large amounts of data could take hours to retrieve
Filename is the name/path that you would like to save the data to.

#---- LoadOldTweets ----#
LoadOldTweets takes 3 parameters as well, startdate, enddate, and items. Similar to LoadData however there is no restriction on how far back you can retrieve tweets
I found that the library that makes this work Is slower than the above library.

StartDate is a date in string form "YYYY-MM-DD"
endDate is a date in string form "YYYY-MM-DD" at least 1 day after StartDate
Items is the amount of tweets that you would like to retrieve -- Large amounts of data could take hours to retrieve.
you must wait 15 minutes between each query of 180 tweets.

SentimentAnalysis.py
#-----------------------#

Run this file to perform the actual sentiment on the data we got from the LoadCSV.py file.

#----getSentimentValues----#
getSentimentValues takes only one parameter which is a Pandas dataframe column of text.
The function iterates through the column and returns 4 values.

Sentiment uses the VaderSentiment package, what I like most about this package is that it works on UTF-8 emojis which I
feel is a big part to calculating sentiment

value 1: the amount of negative sentiment tweets
value 2: the amount of neutral sentiment tweets
value 3: the amount of negative sentiment tweets
value 4: the overall compound score of the column

Data4_18.CVS AND Data4_25.csv
#-----------------------#

Each of these CSV files contain 10,000 tweets relating to the hashtags #Coronavirus and #COVID-19
You'll find that when i submit my paper i use data regarding 30,000 tweets per CSV file, the reason i trimmed it down to 10,000
is to that this compressed project folder isn't too large to submit to mooddle.
Retweets are filtered out
English tweets only

#-----------------------#
Rest of the CSV Files
#-----------------------#

Each of these CSV files contains 50 tweets relating to the hashtags #Coronavirus and #COVID-19
Would have liked to retrieve more data per week however it would've taken ages to grab it.
